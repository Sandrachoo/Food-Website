                                            Speaking of classic taiyaki, you’ll want to visit Naniwaya in Azabu Juban, a taiyaki specialist that’s been making taiyaki for over 100 years. If you’ve never had taiyaki before, that crispy yet fluffy curiously fish shaped pastry that’s traditionally
                                            filled with sweet red bean, give this place a try. And if you’re a taiyaki connoisseur, I think you’ll be a huge fan of this place. The outsides are thin and crisp and the insides are stuffed to the brim with
                                            their famous warm sweetened red bean paste. If you’re ordering takeaway, it can take a long time (apparently they discourage people from ordering just one with quoting a long wait time) but you can put your
                                            order in, wander around the cute shopping area of Azabu Juban and then head back and have a hot and tasty treat.

                                            Melon Pan: You can get melon pan – a soft and fluffy bun topped with a crisp cookie like hat, not melon flavored at all – almost everywhere in Japan but I have two places in Tokyo that I really like because they serve them fresh and hot. One is in Asakusa,
                                            right next to Sensō-ji Temple (the one with the giant lantern), at a bakery called Kagetsudo. The other melon pan place is called Tokyo Melon Pan, a chain that has several melon pan outlets all over Tokyo. The
                                            Kagetsudo melon pan is giant and delicious: crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. It essentially is melt in your mouth kind of bun and even though it’s gigantic, you won’t have any problems
                                            finishing it. The melon pan at Tokyo Melon Pan is slightly more sturdy on the inside with an extremely crispy exterior. I prefer Tokyo Melon Pan, but that probably makes me in the minority because Kagetsudo
                                            is definitely more famous.

                                            Ice cream: There are so many places for ice cream in Tokyo. You can’t go to Tokyo and not have ice cream! If you’re at Tokyo Skytree, hit up Tomorakuno 63℃, a soft serve place where the ice cream is made from fresh milk that’s pasteurized at 63°C for
                                            maximum freshness. They have a black sesame cone that I like pairing with matcha. I also love Melting in the Mouth for their creamy flavor and too-cute shape. But really, most soft-serves, or soft cream, as
                                            it’s known over there, are exceptionally good.

                                            If you do make it to Solamachi, don’t miss Croquant Chou Zaku Zaku! These crispy cream puff sticks are the best cream puffs I’ve ever eaten. They’re extra crispy (croquant in French), thanks to an almond-sugar crust and filled with a rich Hokkaido milk
                                            custard cream. They’re made fresh at each location and are filled to order. You’ll defintely smell them before you see them – they smell warm, cozy, and all kinds of good. They have lots of locations.

                                            Now, I present to you one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, with the most hilarious name: Cheese in the Baum. Cheese in the baum brings together two of Japan’s great dessert loves: cheesecake and baumkuchen. I’m not sure why but baumkuchen,
                                            that German spit cake that looks like the cross section of a tree with a hole cut out of the middle, is very popular in Japan. Nenrinya and Juchheim are very good, but maybe even better is Cheese in the Baum.
                                            They are more of a pop-up kind of thing, but they do have one shop in Futako Tamagawa, which is super out of the way, but also a very cute shopping area with the prettiest Tsutaya Electrics store you’ll ever
                                            see.

                                            If beer is more up your alley, Hitachino Nest, a very popular not-so-indie microbrewery, has several locations you can hit up for a fresh pour. Some of them have snacks and they also serve coffee in adorable owl mugs. If your feet need a break, there’s
                                            a very convenient location right at Tokyo Station. As they like to say, Nest is Best!

                                            If you like fries, mashed potatoes, or anything potato based, visit the Calbee+ store in Tokyo station. Be sure to get a cup of hot poteriko because they are absolutely the best: crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside, they’re kind of like mashed
                                            potatoes in a french fry form. Calbee is also a fun place to shop around for omiyage (food souvenirs) to bring home with you.
