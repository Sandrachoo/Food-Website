                                    When we cook we are starting many chemical reactions. Probably the most fascinating is the caramelization, a sugar transformation reaction. Basically is the oxidation of sugar. The process of caramelization starts with the melting of the sugar at high
                                    temperatures (160 ° C) where the sugars starts to liquefy. Its molecules begin to break and the fragments react with each other forming a whole series of aromatic brown compounds. Simply speaking, caramelization is
                                    the process of removal of water from a sugar followed by isomerization and polymerisation steps. Depending on the types of sugars contained in an ingredient, the temperature at which the caramelization process begins
                                    varies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Making caramel is a simple but sometimes dangerous process because working with melted sugar involves high temperatures! I have experience and in any case when I prepare it, I am always very careful to not burn myself! There are three methods for making
                                    caramel:
                                </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>Dry Caramel</b>: I heat sugar in a pan until it first liquefies and then caramelizes. This method requires a little more experience because you risk to heat to much the sugar and then burn it. Sugar must
                                            not be touched with any utensil.
                                        </li>
                                        <br>

                                            <b>Wet Caramel</b>: For every 300 grams of sugar, I add 150 grams of water. However, the amount of water is not very important because then it’ll evaporate: it only serves to initially dissolve part of the sugar
                                            and start heating it without the risk of burning it. At 160 °C the water is completely evaporated and at 170 °C what’s left is pure, liquefied sugar, which is heated until it caramelizes. From this point, mixing
                                            is no longer a problem. The flavor of the caramel obtained is different depending on the maximum temperature at which it is cooked. This is because sucrose decomposition products are different and have different
                                            aromas and flavors. With a lower temperature I get a sweeter caramel. With a higher temperature, I get a less sweet caramel but more intense, with a more complex flavor.
                                        </li>

                                            <b>Microwave Caramel</b>: it is the simpler and safer method. For every 100 grams of sugar, I add 20 grams of glucose or honey syrup and 10 grams of water. Glucose syrup will help to no melt prematurely the
                                            sugar and, because of the water that contains, it will absorb heat quicker. I mix all the ingredients in a small bowl and then I put in the microwave for 3-5 minutes at maximum power. Depending on the degree
                                            of caramelization, a compound of various colors can be obtained. From light blond to dark red, from brown to blackish (if it has been heated too much and has started to degrade).

                                        Excellent with ice-creams, cakes or crepes, they are really greedy and very simple to prepare. You just have to be very careful to not get burned. That’s the ingredients:

                                        Heat granulated sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly with a high heat resistant rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Be careful not to burn. Once sugar is completely melted, at 170 °C, immediately add the boiling cream. Since the
                                        heavy cream is colder than the caramel, the mixture will rapidly bubble when added. Allow the mixture to boil for 1 minute. It will rise in the pan as it boils. Remove from heat and stir in 1 gr of salt. Allow to
                                        slightly cool down before using. Caramel thickens as it cools. 🙂

                                    <li>
                                        First of all, choose which caramel method you want to use: dry one, wet one or the one in microwave?
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        As the caramel cooks, it’s going to bubble up furiously, so choose a large heavy-based saucepan to cook your sauce and avoid spills.
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        Once your sugar has melted immediately stop stirring or you risk the crystals forming again and ruining the mix. Instead, gently tilt the pan around to allow the sugar to caramelise, prevent burning and to get it to cook evenly.
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        If you’re worried you’ll burn your caramel, or you’d prefer to take the guesswork out of getting to the right spot, try using a sugar thermometer.
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        Use a medium heat. Many people are tempted to crank the heat while you’re starting the cooking process to get things moving. High heat can cause the sugar mixture to burn and there’s no turning back once you’ve gone too hot.
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        The color of the caramel is how you can tell if you’ve cooked it enough. Look for a deep amber color
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>
                                        The deep amber caramel is used to coat molds of cream caramel or flan, prepare crunchy bases, ice creams or puddings.
                                    </li>

                                        Once you’ve burned your caramel, there’s no going back.

                                        Brown caramel is used in small quantities to mix with cream, desserts, and to color sauces and broths.
