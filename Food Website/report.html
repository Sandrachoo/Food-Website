    <h1>
        REPORT
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        Introduction:
    </h3>
    <p>
        In my report, I will be sharing about the story lying beneath my first ever website. The magazine website that I created and coded is food based and I named it as Foodie. The reason I chose food as the topic is because I am an avid fans of food and I
        really wish to share my thoughts, knowledge, foods that I have tasted over the years with more people. Firstly, I divided the homepage into three categories, the header, content and footer. I include navigation button, magazine logo, magazine
        title and description at the header. Users can navigate to other directories through navigation button. Then I include three contents after header. Later, footer contains website contact details, social media and form submission which helps users
        to stay on track on the latest news and any updates on new content. Later, the home page was divided into 3 categories and I differentiate them using different background colour. For content wise, I list them using the same design and structure,
        similar CSS styling was used for recipes, cooking tips and recommendation sites.

    </p>

    <h3>
        Inspiration:
    </h3>
    <p>
        When I first started, I literally have zero idea about which topic to choose However, while navigate through Pinterest and some e-commerce site, I got more inspiration and clearer direction about what I am heading to. Thus, I decided to choose food topic
        because I always find it hard to get valuable information regarding recipes, cooking tips and recommended restaurant all in one website. I have seen different food connoisseur share it in different sites, however I believe that through a better
        rearrangement and restructure, a more knowledgeable website can be formed to benefit more people in return. Besides that, I also got inspired from some food website from Japan. The graphics, layout and animation they practiced are really closed
        to my style and through countless researching I also realized the differences between the western and the Japanese website.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Accessibility:
    </h3>
    <p>
        For accessibility, the feature and design that I applied surround with people with dyslexia. Ensuring the site navigation is easy to use, I tried to include as many icons or related pictures as possible to make sure that it is easy to navigate through
        for people with dyslexia. Besides, I also choose the colour scheme for my site carefully. A cream background is practiced along with distinct coloured text in order to provide good contrast. For instance, I tried to differentiate the contents
        of homepage by using different background colour. Moreover, all the links are double checked to ensure there are no dead links.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Usability:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Foodie supports different screen size from phone to full HD monitor, the layout and structures flexible and adjusts automatically as the screen size is reduced. For instance, the nav bar for recipes, cooking tips and recommendation sites differs from
        side bar to navigation button. This is because mobile version aims for a more explicit version with a cleaner interface, less clutter, and a clear hierarchy of the content. Besides that, users can easily find what they came for and achieve their
        initial goal because the design and layout I practiced for recipes, cooking tips and recommendation sites are consistent. A consistent experience was created across the content sites to keep the visitors mind at ease. They can easily identify
        the content by noticing the layout of it. Lastly, the navigation layout was kept familiar by using pop-up navigation at the top right of the screen in every sites. Thus, users can freely navigate to other sites without redirecting back to the
        previous sites.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Learning:
    </h3>
    <p>
        For CSS wise, it inevitably help me to understand more on CSS positioning. I tried my best to achieve different layout on each section by working on different display, for example display grid for home page header and display flex for other elements.
        However, it is hard to implement them at first since some of the elements does not shrink when the screen size reduces so they just went overlap each other and ended up a whole mess. Then I realized some of elements behave such because their width
        and height were coded in pixel, thus after changing it to percentage instead, it works completely fine. For positioning graphics images, I found it hard to position them to their relative position within the specific range. It is because some
        of the images even after setting their sizes using percentage, they still went off from the section range, thus I tried to research and inspect some other websites and realized that setting the parent element to position relative and the respective
        child element which is the graphics images in my case to position absolute can solve this issue. This is because setting the parent element to position relative can position an element based on its current position without changing layout. Whereas
        by applying position absolute to the graphics images can position the images based on its closest positioned ancestor position which is set to position relative. Thus the images only shrink and expand within the section range.


    </p>

    <p>
        For JavaScript wise, one of the biggest obstacle I faced is making the hand images on the home page animated in and out while scrolling. The hand imagesâ€™ value was each stored in respective variable. However, it failed to return the value by using getElementsByClassName.
        I realised the failure to return value due to some styling on CSS, thus to avoid further confusion and occurrence of bugs, the class and id of an element were separated for different usage in both CSS and JavaScript. Classes for styling in CSS
        whereas IDs for JavaScript purpose. Fortunate enough it works after changing to getElementsById. Personally, I think googling is the best tool to solve bugs, platform like W3Schools, Stack Overflow, MDN and others are good resources to find solution
        for your bugs.
    </p>

    <p>
        For HTML wise, I learn to structure my code better by classifying them into separate div and container. I realised a good structuring in HTML is important for styling wise in CSS. I always seek advice from my classmates regarding to my ideas and code
        structure, and one of them actually gave a very honest advice regarding to my code in HTML. The div elements were over coded and redundant and it makes styling in CSS more complicated in return.

    </p>

    <h3>
        Evaluation I:
    </h3>

    <p>
        I think my CSS structure layout were particularly well done. The colour, images, animation and structure applied are quite appealing and match with each other overall. I did quite some research regarding to the design and eventually came up with some
        mockups. I tried to mix and match some of the ideas and inspiration I got it from some e-commerce site and food vlog and eventually came out with the outcome. Besides, the animation from JavaScript creates a more interactive website. I love the
        idea of hands animate in and out while scrolling, resulting a more fun and lively sites for any avid fans of food. I feel extremely satisfied and surprised as I have a deeper understanding of CSS where it will be useful someday in the near future.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Evaluation II:
    </h3>

    <P>
        I think my usage of JavaScript libraries are still very limited. Most of the Javascript I applied is nearly vanilla JavaScript and only very limited libraries are used. I have seen experts in web development field sharing about the importance of using
        libraries in workplace, it clarifies the code better and make the whole development process easier. Thus, after completing my websites, I did look through some libraries available, Barba.js is one of it, it is a great library which allow fancy
        page transitions. Thus, I am pretty excited and looking forward to include more libraries in my next coding experience.
    </P>
